# Simple-Auction
This is a simple auction program which is based on Java Remote Method Invocation. There is a Client side and Server side where the Client only can take input and create basic user interface in the terminal. The Server processes the input and allows the user to:
- create an account which is temporarily stored
- put items up for auction
- bid on other items with other users (when the program is run more than once on the same device)
